This paper presents a review of the latest developments in detecting and grading knee osteoarthritis (KOA) using deep learning, with a focus on hybrid models combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and YOLO-based models. Three investigations from 2024-2025 are discussed: a CNN-based Kellgren-Lawrence grading system, a hierarchical classification model with segmentation, and an enhanced YOLO-assisted detection system using Minkowski distance. Additionally, we propose a novel hybrid model that integrates the strengths of ResNet-50 and YOLOv8, where ResNet-50 excels in feature extraction for accurate grading and YOLOv8 specializes in region localization and early-stage detection. By combining these two frameworks, the hybrid model demonstrates improved performance in both classification accuracy and real-time detection, making it a promising tool for more accurate and explainable KOA diagnosis in clinical settings. This hybrid approach could lead to the development of a robust diagnostic system suitable for real-time clinical applications.
